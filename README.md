# simple-webserver
A lightweight, threaded webserver that should be able to display content the same way something like Apache does, albeit without SSL, virtual hosts, or any other server configurations. All basic features (HTML/CSS, JS, images, videos, etc.) appear to be working correctly. It also supports PHP preprocessing.

I started this because I was interested in how webservers were able to serve content, so I thought the best way to learn would be to write one myself, manually accepting TCP requests and parsing the HTTP requests.

I want to also add other HTTP request methods so that this can be used to create a REST API.
